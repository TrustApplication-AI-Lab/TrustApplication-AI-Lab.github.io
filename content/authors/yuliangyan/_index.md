I’m currently a first year PhD at HKUST (GZ), surpervised by Prof Enyan DAI. Prior to this, I obtained my master’s degree from Fudan University, where I specialized in Natural Language Processing under the guidance of Professor Xiaoqing ZHENG in the FudanNLP Lab. My current research interests focus on Trustworthy LLMs, foundational models, and AI for Science.
